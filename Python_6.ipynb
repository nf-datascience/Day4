However, there are plenty of times when we don't care about order, either because it simply doesn't matter or because the data are associated with each other in a different way. For example, say we have a bunch of state names and we want to associate each state's name with its capital. How would we do this in a list? One way would be to have tuples that store pairs of states and their capitals."

In the unordered paradigm where dictionaries live, to change/add a key-value pair, all you have to do is index into it with the existing/new key and assign a value to it.

    "#### Caveat to Dictionary Keys, More on Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that dictionaries make it easy to store key-value relationships in a single data structure. We have also learned that dictionaries are designed for easy value retrieval (thing about the capital retrieval with a list versus a dictionary). What are the restrictions on things you can put in a dictionary? As for the values, like in lists, there are none! But in terms of the keys those values are associated with, that's a different story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys in dictionaries **must** be an immutable type, and if that type is a container, then the container cannot contain any mutable types. Why is this the case? The answer lies in the way that dictionaries store values and associate them with a key.\n",

    "Python dictionaries are an implementation of what's known as a *hash map* or *hash table* ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) the wikipedia page for them if you want to learn more). This computer science idea is basically a function that relates any input, in our case the keys, to a location in memory. Thus, retrieval of a value from a dictionary is entirely dependent on the key. The consequence of this is that, if we were to use a mutable type as the key for a dictionary and later change what that key looked like by mutating it, the dictionary wouldn't be able to find the value it was supposed to associate with that key (since the key has now changed).
