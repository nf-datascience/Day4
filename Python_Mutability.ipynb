    "\n",
    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So, have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "## Data Structures Continued\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now you have learned about some very useful data structures in Python - numeric types, strings, and lists. However, the fun doesn't stop there! Today, we are going to talk about some other data structures that will allow us to solve very different problems from those that we have been solving so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that will come up as an important distinction in the structures we learn about today is the concept of mutability. **Mutability** refers to the capability of an object to be changed after it has been instantiated. With lists, we can change the contents at any arbitrary index and even grow the list dynamically..."

    "Mutability is nice, but there are times when we won't want our data structure to be mutable. For example, if we're allowing a user of our program to have access to a data structure, one way to ensure that they won't mess with it (sometimes users do this out of malice, and we want to try and prevent it) is to make the structure **immutable**. There are many more reasons why immutability is a desired trait, and we will discuss plenty more of them throughout the rest of the course.\n",

Immutable you say? But, I can change a value in a variable after it's been declared. Consider the following simple code."

    "How can numerics be immutable while at the same time allowing us to change the value of a variable that holds a numeric? What's going on under the hood when you assign a value to a variable is that Python puts that value or data structure in memory, and then simply associates the variable name with that value or data structure. Changing a variable, then, simply amounts to associating that name with a different thing in memory.\n",

    "Using this same logic, we can see why strings are immutable as well. The contents of a string are put in memory, and the variable name you want to use is associated with that string.

You cannot make a tuple longer. You cannot reassign what is in a tuple (there are some subtleties to this which we will discuss shortly). Similar to lists, tuples are declared by passing an iterable to the `tuple()` constructor, with or without the syntactic sugary parenthesis (this works because Python automatically interprets comma separated things that aren't specifically specified otherwise as tuples)."

Just as with lists, the elements of tuples can be accessed via zero-based indexing, and looped through with a `for` loop.

Let's stick with looking at tuples for now, and take a look at some of the things we can store."
