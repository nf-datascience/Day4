    "Throughout this entire notebook you should be experimenting with the code in the non-text cells. A great way to begin to get a feel for Python is by playing with it. So have some fun by changing the values in the cells and then running them again with Shift-Enter. Before you do, think about what you expect the output to be, and make sure your intuition matches up with what you run. If it doesn't, take some time to think about what happened so you can hone your intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each section there will be some questions to help further your understanding. Remember, in Python we can always manually test things by trying them out; however, you should try to think about the answers to these questions before you run some code. This way you can check and verify your understanding of the section's topic.\n",

    "Lists are a more complex type of data structure than strings. From a high level, lists are collections of ordered items. These items can be of any type, and a list can contain items of different types (or all the same type). You can construct a list in one of two ways. The first is simply by passing an arbitrary number of items into square brackets, `[]`, separated by commas. The second is by passing an iterable into the `list()` constructor (we'll discuss exactly what an iterable and constructor are later). For example..."

You can simply write `for <variable name> in <iterable>:`, and at each iteration through the loop you will be able to access another element from that iterable via `variable name`. Also, as mentioned above, the `list()` constructor accepts any iterable as an argument, and then creates a `list`, where each element in the iterable is a single element in the `list`."
